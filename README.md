# hello-world
This is a (not so functional) tester repository,where I simply play with GitHub for scientific purpuce.

FYI, shyZombie likes cold beer and low-graphic video games, because he does not own a high-end PC ;( 
He trust that drinking and coding are solitary sports, but sometimes teamwork is necessary.
